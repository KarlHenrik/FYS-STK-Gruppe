# FYS-STK Project 1

### Code Folder
The Jupyter notebook "Project1.ipynb" contains all off the code that was used to find the results of the report. Due to a lot of random generation and shuffling of data, you might not see exactly the same results on your run of the code. The notebook contains some explanations of what different parts of the code are for. All code in the notebook were written by us for this project. The notebook contains output from a complete run, this run is not the same as the one which produced the plots used in the report (as there was testing done after our results were saved).

The folder "Figures" is where figures from running the notebook are saved, and "FiguresOld" contains the figures from the runs of the code that were used in the report.

"denver.tif" contains the terrain data that is fit and analyzed in "Project1.ipynb"

### Report Folder

Contains our report pdf.
