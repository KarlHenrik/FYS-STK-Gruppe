# FYS-STK Project 1

The Jupyter notebook "Project1.ipynb" contains all off the code that was used to find the results of the report. Due to a lot of random generation and shuffling of data, you might not see excactly the same results on your run of the code. The notebook contains some explanations of what different parts of the code are for. All code in the notebook were written by us for this project.

The folder "Figures" is where figures from running the notebook are saved, and "FiguresOld" contains the figures from the runs of the code that were used in the report.

"denver.tif" contains the terrain data that is fit and analyzed in "Project1.ipynb"

"Project1Assignment.ipynb" contains the Project 1 description and exercises.
